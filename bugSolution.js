The solution often involves meticulously reviewing the Firebase security rules.  Double-check the read and write permissions for all relevant paths and make sure they are properly nested to account for the hierarchical data structure.

Here's an example:

```javascript
// Incorrect rule (too restrictive)
"$path": {
  "child": {
    '.read': true,
     '.write': true
  }
}

// Correct rule (more permissive, allows access to child nodes)
"$path": {
  '.read': true,
  '.write': true
}
```

The most common cause is incorrect nesting in the security rules.  Instead of defining permissions deep within the path, the solution might require less specific rules to allow access.   Sometimes adding `$path` wildcards strategically can help.  Use the Firebase console's rule simulator to test your changes.
